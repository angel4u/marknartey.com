## Research Overview

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of English](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/engl/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University and a member of the [Research Center for Professional Communication in English (RCPCE)](http://rcpce.engl.polyu.edu.hk/rcpce/). I am an interdisciplinary scholar who specializes in
corpus-assisted discourse studies and in the theory and application
of critical discourse analysis in political, media and other public
discourses.
I am interested in the interplay of discourse, ideology and
mythology, and I explore these from a critical discourse analytical
perspective.

The main analytic and/or theoretical frameworks I adopt are discourse-historical analysis, critical metaphor analysis and discourse-mythological analysis, combining them with corpus methods and insights from history, communication studies and political science. My published work has drawn heavily on comparative and interdisciplinary research frameworks, with some exploring phenomena in Ghana, China, Australia and the UK. I have published extensively in the field of (applied) linguistics; my recent papers have appeared in journals such as <i>Corpora</i>, <i>World Englishes</i>, <i>Language and Intercultural Communication</i>, <i>Critical Discourse Studies</i>, and <i>Journal of Language and Politics</i>, among others. Continuing in my interdisciplinary orientation, my current research direction has four strands:

- exploring discourse mythology and
  populist ideology from a comparative East-West or Africa-West or
  Africa-Asia perspective;
- analyzing emancipatory discourses of less powerful groups, focusing on how they counter discriminatory practices directed at them;
- investigating discourses on the Chinese
  and other Asian population groups in Ghana (e.g. Indians, Lebanese);
- examining the discursive construction of minority groups in
  the Ghanaian media and in the English media in Hong Kong.
